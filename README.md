============================
*** this will be a db design task
*** consider a student registration system
*** for the courses, you can have IT (Information Technology), SE (Software Engineering), CSN (Computer systems and Networking), IS (Information Systems)
*** we should be able to select them from a dropdown
*** when a student registers to the system, he should have his registration number generated in the following template
*** <<course>><<current year>><<running number>> Example: SE20240001 or CSN20240002
*** note that, students may change their course in the future
*** postpondments are not accepted and if they apply in the next year, they will be given a new registration number
*** implement the student register number.
*** in the Student table, what can be the primary key?
*** how do you handle a course change?
*** how do you generate the running number?
*** explain to me please
